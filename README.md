As Mentioned in question 2 Screen and a single resuable componenet
Single Reusable class:PopUpandNavigation

How to use:
PopUpandNavigation popnav = PopUpandNavigation();
    popnav.goToNewPage(context, NexPage),
    popnav.showPopupBanner(context,width,RequiredBannerWidget,)

This could be rendered anywhere in project and to prove it i've added it to new page's center text<br />
Implemented it in home page as per requirement

About Code:

Used ShowDialog() to show baner onclick
and Navigatior for changing page

If it was asked to implement it without usng ShowDialog then I would havee implemented it with Adding that banner in stack and using Provider State controller and Change notifier kind of class.

Have standard contant resusabe widgits in seperate file
